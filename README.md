# Malwares-sources
A collection of sources of malwares which i obtained by decompiling them. Don't skid pls

To decompile exes, if they are .net then i use dnSpy, and unpack them if needed. If they are native exes, then i use 
IDA pro, and: i find pieces of code which are understandable, rewrite them better, and create a file in which i collect these
pieces of code, this means that for native exes you will only find a stub of the original source, in this repo.

If you want your malware to be removed from this repository, please refer to the contact section below:
